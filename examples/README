This directory contains simulation examples for two different systems: a MixTS approach to water (in which the hydrogen atoms are treated with 32 beads and the oxygen atoms treated with
4 beads) and a MixTS Co2+ simulation (where the Co2+ ion is treated as a classical Co3+ with a 1024 bead RP electron is solvated in a box of classical water molecules).

water_example: the input files for the MixTS water simulation (in which the hydrogen atoms are treated with 32 beads and the oxygen atoms treated with
4 beads). The results.tar.gz shows the results/output generated by these input files for comparison. Inside the results.tar.gz are also the input files and results 
generated using the pi_rdf.F analysis code (which generates radial distribution functions). 

co_1024x_example: the input files for the MixTS Co2+ simulation (where the Co2+ ion is treated as a classical Co3+ with a 1024 bead RP electron is solvated in a box of classical water molecules). 
The results.tar.gz shows the results/output generated by these input files for comparison. Inside the results.tar.gz are also the input files and results 
generated using the pi_rdf.F analysis code (which generates radial distribution functions). 

generate_input: Contains a program (make_pimd_input.F) which generates the input files needed for each of the simulations describe above.
