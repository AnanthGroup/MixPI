This is an example of the input files needed to run 1bead (classical) Co3+ with a 1024 bead PI electron (designated at atom type XX) 
solvated in a box of 91 water molecules in a 14 A box using the SPC/E force-field with a MixTS approach. This
simulation is done in the MixTS framework where the Co3+ ion and the water molecules are classical while the 
electron is treated as a 1024 bead PI. Partially simulation details also include:

	We center the electron on the Co3+ by constraining the centroid of the PI electron to the metal center. (See
	information on cp2k.inp and md_contraints.inp for details.)
	We must define a modified Coulombic potential between the PI electron beads and the positively charged atoms
	in the simulation. This is done by "bonding" the electron beads and the Co3+ ion and introducing a defined potential
        between these atoms (see RP_FF_bond.pot/RP_FF_nonbond.pot). We also introduce an rcut value at which the force between
	the electron beads and the positively charged atoms zeros out. See the MixPI User Manual (and the paper's cited within) 
	for a discussion about this treatment.  


md_run.inp: input file for the MD parameters of MixPI
file_info.inp: input file listing input/output files of interest in MixPI
md_contraint.inp: information on the contraints (frozen atoms, centroid contraints) for the system. For this example, the centroid of
	PI electron is harmonic contrained to the Co3+ center.
cp2k.inp: a cp2k input file that describes the force-field utilized by the simulation. The following additional
input files are called by cp2k.inp. Note that for this simulation, a collective variable is defined in the CP2K input file that harmonically contraints 
the electron centroid to the Co3+ ion. 
        FF_file.pot: the CP2K force-field file that contains all the force information (can be included in the cp2k.inp file, was separated for
		readability).
	RP_FF_nonbond.pot: CP2K force-field file that describes the LJ interactions for PI (XX-Co) and PI-classical (XX-HW, XX-OW, CO-HW, CO-OW) atoms in the system.
	RP_FF_bond.pot: CP2K force-field file that describes the bonded interactions for PI atoms (XX-Co) atoms in the system.
 	RP_structure.xyz: xyz structure file which lists positions of all PI beads and classical atoms in system
	RP_molset.pot: a "molset" file (cp2k format) that describes the topology of the PI atoms in the system when combined with PSF files
	classical_molset.pot: a "molset" file (cp2k format) that describes the topology of the classical atoms in the system when combined with PSF files
	RP_type.pot: CP2K file that defines the atom types for the PIs
rp_molecule_info.inp: file that describes the PIs degrees of freedom. It has the following form:
         number of RP molecules
               ---following block is repeated number of RP times
         number of atoms in molecule       number of times this molecule shows up in xyz file    psf_file
         number of beads on each atom in order of xyz file	mass of bead in amu (kg/mol)
rp-1-electron.psf: The psf file that describes the 1024 bead electron bonded to 1 bead Co3+ topology. All PI beads are shown in the psf file. Specific
formats for the molecule name, atom name, and atom type are required for MixPI. The molecule name (column 2) must start with RP. Atom name 
(column 5) is an atom identifier (in this case XX or CO) and the bead number (1,2,...1024 or 1). The atom type (column 6) is the force-field type and is
the number of PI beads (in this case 1024 or 1) combined with an atomic label (XX or CO). Column 7 is the charge on each bead (the total atomic charge 
divided by the number of beads: -1.0/1024=-0.000977 and 3.0/1=3.0 ). Column 8 is the mass (which, for our PI treatment, should
always be the atomic mass divide by the number of beads: 0.00054858/1024=0.00000054 kg/mol and 58.933/1=58.933 kg/mol).
water.psf: the psf file that describes the topology for the water molecules in the simulation.
 
 
OUTPUT:
Here is a list of the output files that are generated and the information they contain.

atom-vel.dat: Initial velocities of the classical atoms (listed in bohr/time(au) ). If line 12 in md_run.inp (init_vel_rp) == .true., this file is generated. If == .false., this file is read in for the initial velocities. 
energy_virial.dat: An energy output file with the following columns (all energies in hartree)
step	time(fs)	temperature (K)	kinetic virial energy	potential virial energy	kinetic primitive energy	total energy as sum of kinetic virial and potential virial
	NOTE: The energy estimators are derived in literature and also outlined in the User Manual.

energy_average.dat: A running average for the values printed in the energy_virial.dat file above. Currently hardcoded to ignore the first 40% of the simulation. Can (and will be) changed by modifying line 344 in md_run.F.

final_atom-vel.xyz, final_rp-vel.xyz, and final_structure.xyz are the classical atom velocities, classical PI velocities, and final structures for the last frame of the simulation. If conducting a RESTART, do the following replacements.
	cp final_atom-vel.xyz atom-vel.dat
	cp final_rp-vel.xyz rp-vel.dat
	cp final_structure.xyz RP_structure.xyz
and change line 12 in md_run.F (init_vel_rp) to .false.

output.out: the output generated by the CP2K output files

rp-vel.dat: Initial velocities of the PI beads (listed in bohr/time(au) ). If line 12 in md_run.inp (init_vel_rp) == .true., this file is generated. If == .false., this file is read in for the initial velocities. 

runtime_info.dat: information on the time in takes to run a various components of the MixPI for the initial step. The second value on each line is the time that subroutine took in seconds. 

trajectory_run_centroid.dat: A trajectory file for the entire system using the centroid positions for any PIs.

trajectory_run_full.xyz: A trajectory file with the full configurations (all PI beads and all classical atoms). 


IF (print_level=high) the following additional output files are generated.

trajectory_all.xyz:  this prints out a trajectory file for the full configurations (all PI beads and all classical atoms)
	with the first three columns as the position in A and the second three columns are the velocities in A/fs.

trajectory_run_com.dat: A trajectory file for the entire system which keeps the center of mass of the box at x=0.0; y=0.0; z=0.0.

energy_actual.dat: An energy output file that contains the following columns:
step	time(fs)	classical atom kinetic energy (H)	potential energy from cp2k (H)	PI kinetic energy	bead spring potential energy (H)	kinetic virial energy (H)	potential virial energy (H)	kinetic primtive energy (H)
	NOTE: The energy estimators (in the finally three columns) are derived in literature and also outlined in the User Manual.
