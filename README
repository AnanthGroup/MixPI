      MixPI: Mixed-Time Slicing RPMD Atomistic Software

![TOC FIGURE](./images/toc.pn)


MixPI is an atomistic molecular dynamics software package which conducts path-integral molecular dynamics and ring polymer molecular dynamics simulations using the mixed-time slicing approach. Mixed-time slicing PIMD/RPMD allows for the quantization of specific atoms in the simulation to different degrees; 
this approach can significantly reduce the computational cost of PIMD/RPMD simulations, especially for atomistic simulation with large system sizes. MixPI is written in Fortran and interfaces with the molecular dynamics software
CP2K for force and energy evaluations. See the citations below for more information on the mixed-time slicing PIMD method.

## Installation
Detailed installation instructions are provided in the PDF MixPI Manual in the repository. MixPI requires the installation of CP2K, which can be found at https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/blob/master/INSTALL.md. 
The main repository contains the most recent developer version of MixPI that may contain additional features or parameters that are not outlined in the MixPI manual. MixPI v2.1 (the most recent version published on the GitHub page) is the most recent version 
of MixPI to have undergone limited compile and runtime checks and is up to date with the PDF Manual in the repository. MixPI is a code under active development and may contain bugs or errors.
