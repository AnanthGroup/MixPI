Simple CP2K Fortran Driver that Links to CP2K library and runs a path integral simulation.
It also prints the positions and forces to additional files.


COMPILE DRIVER:
To compile the main driver program:
make 

Additional options are
1. make clean to remove all executables and all .o and .mod files
2. make pimd_mod.o will just compile/update the module file

Additional files/modules can be added. The make file contains comments outlining
the procedure. The make file links the external driver to the CP2K library. It will
need to be updated if location of CP2K library changes. 
In addition, the same versions of gcc/intelmpi need to be loaded for the driver
as were loaded for the original CP2K library build. (My versions are shown below.)




CREATE AND LINK CP2K LIBRARY
Below are the instructions for obtaining and linking the CP2K library.

1. Inside cp2k folder, create library with a similar make command used to compile CP2K
make -j N ARCH=constance-gf-mkl-mvapich VERSION=sopt libcp2k
NOTES:
For my build, I used an arch file called constance-gf-mkl-mvapich.sopt (also in this directory 
for completeness). I had the following modules loaded:
Currently Loaded Modulefiles:
  1) intel/16.0.2         2) intelmpi/5.0.2.044   3) gcc/6.1.0            4) mvapich2/2.1         5) python/3.7.2 


2. This creates a folder cp2k/lib/constance-gf-mkl-mvapich/sopt/ that contains a list of .a libraries. The relevant cp2k library
is libcp2k.a. A folder called cp2k/obj/constance-gf-mkl-mvapich/sopt/ is also generated that contains all of the .mod/.o/.F90 
files for CP2K. For future linking, I also copied the file cp2k/src/start/libcp2k.h into this file.
These paths are included in the make file as library and include paths.

3. For Fortran links, you also need to link to the dbcsr files. The dbcsr library is location in 
cp2k/lib/constance-gf-mkl-mvapich/sopt/exts/dbcsr/ and the .mod/.o files are located at 
cp2k/obj/constance-gf-mkl-mvapich/sopt/exts/dbcsr. These paths are also shown in the make file.
